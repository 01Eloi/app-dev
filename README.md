1. A Dog's Journey is a movie about a dog who finds the meaning of his own existence through the lives of the humans he meets. After fulfilling his purpose of taking care of Ethan, Bailey must do the same thing for Ethan's granddaughter, CJ. As CJ does everything that she can do to achieve her goal to become a musician, Bailey is able to find her again through multiple lifetimes. The movie is adapted from W.Bruce Cameron’s best-selling novels and follows a Buddhist philosophy, imagining a world in which a dog’s spirit reincarnates in the body of a new adorable puppy.
